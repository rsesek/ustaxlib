# ustaxlib/fed2021

Forms for US tax year 2021.

This is an *overlay* of the [fed2020](../fed2020/README.md) module. An overlay module inherits (and
therefore supports) all of the forms from its parent.

# Adjustments
Currently this module only updates the tax table and inflation-adjusted constants of the **Tax
Return**.
