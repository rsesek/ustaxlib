# ustaxlib/fed2020

Forms for US tax year 2020.

This is an *overlay* of the [fed2019](../fed2019/README.md) module. An overlay module inherits (and
therefore supports) all of the forms from its parent.

# Adjustments
Besides updating the tax table and inflation-adjusted constants of the **Tax Return**, updated
versions of the following forms are provided. These replace the forms from the fed2019 overlay:

- **Form 1040**
- **Schedule 3**
